        - "Venus"
        - "Earth"

    2. Add the string "Jupiter" to the END of the array

    4. Remove the last two strings from the array
    5. Remove the first two strings from the array

/*
    1. Create a variable called "multiple" and initialize it to 5
    2. Create an array with the numbers 10-15 (inclusive)
    3. Loop through the array and on each iteration:
        - Multiply the number by the multiple and print out the result
        - As you're printing, use this format (example):
            10 x 5 = 50
            11 x 5 = 55
            ...
            15 x 5 = 75

    BONUS: Try to see if you can make it so that all you need to change
    is the "multiple" variable and the program still works correctly.

/*
    Create a variable called "greeting" and initialize it to:
        "Hello, nice to meet you!"
    
    Use a loop to loop through this String (just like you would an array)

    WHY does this happen?
    WHAT is a String, really?

        - 98
        - 91

/*
    Create a variable called "bakery" that points to an array
    Fill the array with the following String:
        - "Cake"
        - "Cookie"
        - "Bread"
        - "Scone"

    Print out bakery to make sure it has these 4 Strings in it.

    Create another variable called "myBakery" and assign it
    to "bakery" that we declared previously

    Add the following items to "myBakery":
        - "Croissant"
        - "Granola"

    Print out myBakery and bakery and observe the contents.

    WHY is this?
