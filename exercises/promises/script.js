           myPromise.then(...).then(...) // steps 5-7
           myPromise.then(...).then(...) // steps 8-10

    BONUS: WHY does it work this way?

/*
    1. Create a Promise that resolves with the number 10 after
       3 seconds
    2. Create another Promise that resolves with the number
       20 after 5 seconds

    How can we log out the sum (30) of these two resolved values
    once, after BOTH promises successfully fulfill?
