/*
    Let's see how a "Factory" class/function might work

    1. Create a class called "EnemyFactory"

    2. Make the following work to produce the output shown:

    const factory = new EnemyFactory();
    const flying = factory.generateFlyingEnemy("batman");
    flying.fly(); // batman can fly!

    const swimming = EnemyFactory.generateSwimmingEnemy("aquaman");
    swimming.swim(); // aquaman can swim!

    * What is the difference between these two? When might you
      even use this? Where are the property keys of each of these:
      - EnemyFactory
      - factory
      - factory.__proto__
      - flying.__proto__
      - swimming.__proto__
*/

class EnemyFactory {
    generateFlyingEnemy(name) {
        class FlyingEnemy {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name
            }

            fly() {
                console.log(`${this.name} can fly!`)
            }
        }
        return new FlyingEnemy(name)
    }
}

EnemyFactory.generateSwimmingEnemy = function(name) {
    class SwimmingEnemy {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name
        }

        swim() {
            console.log(`${this.name} can swim!`)
        }
    }
    return new SwimmingEnemy(name)
}

const factory = new EnemyFactory()
const flying = factory.generateFlyingEnemy("batman")
// flying.fly()

const swimming = EnemyFactory.generateSwimmingEnemy("aquaman")
// swimming.swim()

// console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(EnemyFactory))
// console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(factory))
// console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(factory.__proto__))
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(flying))
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(flying.__proto__))
