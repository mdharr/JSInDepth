    1. If you were to design your own class for your
       project, what questions would you ask while 
       deciding whether to make something a static or
       instance field/method/property?

    2. How about private or public accessors for these

/*
    If I were to design my own class for a project, when desciding
    to make something a static or instance field/method/property,
    I would ask the following:
    - Is it necessary to instantiate a new object to use this method?
    - Will the functionality be unique to each class instance?
    - How often will I need to use these fields/methods/properties?

    For private or public accessors, I would ask:
    - Should the user/developer have direct access to them?
    - Will unlimited access to these fields/methods/properties
    potentially cause issues and crash the program by leading
    to unintended use or unexpected bugs
